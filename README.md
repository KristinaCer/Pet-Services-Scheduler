# Pet Services Scheduler

****Pet Services** Scheduler** is a SaaS application that provides a scheduling interface for a small business that takes care of animals. This Spring Boot project will allow users to create pets, owners, and employees, and then schedule events for employees to provide services for pets. 

**The project supports the following workflow:**
1. Create a new customer.
2. Create a pet for that customer.
3. Create an employee.
4. Update the employeeâ€™s schedule.
5. Find out which employees with the right skills are available on a given date.
6. Schedule one or more employees to do a set of activities with one or more pets.
7. Look up currently scheduled events for an employee, a pet, or a customer.

The project was implemented as an Udacity Java Web Developer nanodegree assignment.
